    <string name="about">About:\n\n
        This App lets you explore different patterns found in nature.
        You can play around with different variables to see how it affects
        the result.\n\n

        Fractal Tree:\n
        In mathematics, a fractal is an abstract object used to describe and
        simulate naturally occurring objects. Artificially created fractals
        commonly exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales.
        It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the
        replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a
        self-similar pattern.\n\n

        Phyllotaxis:\n
        In botany, phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem.
        A repeating spiral can be represented by a fraction describing the angle of windings
        leaf per leaf.\n\n

        Enjoy!\n\n

        More coming soon.
